java- to run the application
javac- java compiler- needed to compile the application
jshell- it's a tool run on terminal to execute java code getting immediate results
methods- in java to do anything we have to use methods.
Systtem.out.print- to print something
JVM- java is platform independent it doesn't care about hardware or OS it only requires JVM. it only understands byte code. 

person->java code->javac->byte code-> jvm->jre

execution starts from main - public static void main (string arg[])
java is object oriented
JRE- Java Runtime Environment-JRE is a software package that provides libraries and environment for running Java applications.Provides essential libraries and dependencies required to run Java programs.
JVM- Java Virtual Machine-JVM is an abstract machine that executes Java bytecode.
Converts Java bytecode into machine-specific code at runtime.

Java is platform-independent because Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Unlike languages like C or C++, which generate platform-specific machine code, Java’s bytecode is the same across all platforms.ja
This means that once you compile Java code on one system, you can run it on any other system with a compatible JVM—without recompilation
WORA – Write Once, Run Anywhere
WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere) means that Java developers only need to write and compile their program once, and it can run on any operating system with a JVM.
datatypes- primitive->integers, float, characters, boolean- simple, basic, easy to use with--subtypes
integers- byte, short, int, long
float- double, float use(f)
character-2 bytes, unicode
boolean- true or false
