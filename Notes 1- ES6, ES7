at the end of everything everything is converted into bytecode
you can never directly execute typescript. it transpiles into javascript then executes.
javascript can run on node js because it is built on google's v8 engine
ts->js-> interpreted
Transpile- combination of transformation and compilation. transforming one source code to another source code.
Compile
because of type safety we should use type script
Detects errors at compile time instead of runtime.
