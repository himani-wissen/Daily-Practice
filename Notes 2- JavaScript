ctrl+ L= empty console
alert("");= pop up in page
console.log("");
variables are containers for data
don't need to mention data type
variables are case sensitive- upper and lowercase matters
in 2015 ES6- ECMA script 6- new standards, rules, features 
var: old concept, can be re-declared and updated. global scope variable. can be used anywhere in code
let: can not be redeclared but can be updated. a block scoped variable. can be used in between {}.
const: variable cannot be redeclared or updated. a block scoped variable.
if we declare a variable using let but don't assign it a value then it will print undefined.
DATA TYPES IN JS
primitive data types- 7 types- number, string, Boolean, null, bigint, symbol, undefined
non-primitive data types- objects-arrays, functions- objects is a collection of values. key-value pairs
we can update the const object's key  
typeof- to check data type
const object{
	name: xyz,
	age: 234,
	}
COMMENTS
//- single line
/**/- multi line
OPERATORS
arithmetic- unary operator- they need only one operand- incrment and decrement- post and pre, pre does the operation and stores it first then print, post assigns it and then does the operation from  the next line.
ternary operator-3 operands- a1>a2 ? b:c
comparison operators- ==: checks values, ===: checks value and data type- stricter version, !=
logical operators- &&, ||,!
bitwise operator
CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
if statement
if else statement
else if statement
switch statement

ALERT- only message
PROMPT= allows some input with message
prompt("");

LOOPS IN JS
loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again
for(let i=5; i<=5; i++){
	console.log("");
}
infinite loop: a loop that never ends
while loops: while(condition){
//updation
}
do-while loops: runs atleast once
	do{
	//does some work
	}while (condition);
for-of loops: help to iterate some special data types likes strings and arrays. goes through the entire string or array.
	for(let val of strVar){
		//do some work
	}
for-in loops: it has keys of the object for example-
let student={
	name: "Rahul",
	age: 20,
	cgpa:7.5
	};
for (let key in student){
	console.log("key=",key,"value=",student[key]);
	}
STRINGS IN JS
let str= "";
str.length
str indices start from 0
TEMPLATE LITERALS IN JS: a way to have embedded expressions in strings. it is a string only. it uses backtiks.
string interpolation: to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders.
escape characters: \n, \t, counts as a single character.
STRING METHODS: built in functions to manipulate a string. strings are immuatable meaning no change. everytime new string is created.
str.toUpperCase()
str.toLowerCase()
str.trim()- removes white spaces
str.concat= str1+str2
str.replace= search in string and replace the value
str.charAt= find value at index

ARRAYS IN JS: collection of items of same type
arr.length;
property gives value, method does some work
array is a type of object only
arrays are mutable
strings are immutable
